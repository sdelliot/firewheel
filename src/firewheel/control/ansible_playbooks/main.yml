# Playbook: Install Model Component
# Description:
#   This Ansible playbook is designed to install extra dependencies for a model component
#   such as file retrieval or data processing. It does this by first checking if the necessary
#   files are available via a cache mechanism, including Git, S3, and a standard file server
#   (via a URL). If a cache is not available, than it provides a naive check for online access
#   and, if needed executes the tasks that are provided in the model component
#   ``INSTALL/tasks.yml`` file.
#
#   The playbook performs the following steps:
#   1. Imports variables from the specified model component.
#   2. Attempts to retrieve required files from cache using the 'firewheel' role.
#   3. Checks the online status of the system by pinging 8.8.8.8.
#   4. If all cache retrieval methods fail and the system is offline, it raises a failure message.
#   5. If the system is online, it runs the model component-provided tasks.
#   6. Performs a final check for required files.
